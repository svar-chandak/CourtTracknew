# Tournament System Integration Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Components

### Core Infrastructure
1. **Database Schema** (`player-tournament-schema.sql`)
   - `tournament_players` - Links players to tournaments with school/UTR
   - `tournament_bracket_slots` - Bracket structure with drag-drop positions
   - `tournament_bracket_matches` - Individual player matches
   - `tournament_settings` - Bracket lock status

2. **TypeScript Types** (`lib/player-tournament-types.ts`)
   - All interfaces for player-based tournaments

3. **Tournament Engine** (`lib/player-tournament-engine.ts`)
   - School grouping with UTR calculations
   - Two-pool bracket generation
   - Same-school conflict resolution
   - Validation logic

4. **Store** (`stores/player-tournament-store.ts`)
   - All CRUD operations for player tournaments
   - Bracket generation and management

### UI Components
1. **Join Dialog** (`components/tournaments/join-tournament-player-dialog.tsx`)
   - Code entry + player selection
   - ‚úÖ Fixed: Now uses Supabase directly

2. **Bracket Display** (`components/tournaments/two-sided-bracket.tsx`)
   - Two-sided visual bracket (Pool A / Pool B)
   - UTR display on slots
   - Drag-and-drop with validation
   - Lock/unlock functionality
   - School average UTR on hover

3. **Simple Manager** (`components/tournaments/simple-tournament-manager.tsx`)
   - Tournament overview
   - School summary with avg UTR
   - Generate bracket button
   - Integrates bracket display

## üîß What Needs Integration

### 1. Update tournaments-matches/page.tsx
- Replace old `JoinTournamentDialog` with `JoinTournamentPlayerDialog`
- Add `SimpleTournamentManager` when viewing tournaments
- Keep team matches section separate (that's working)

### 2. Tournament Creation
- Update `CreateTournamentDialog` to work with player-based tournaments
- Or create new `CreatePlayerTournamentDialog`

### 3. Score Entry (Next Phase)
- Component to enter scores for bracket matches
- Winner progression to next round
- Match completion UI

## üìã Quick Integration Steps

1. **Add to tournaments-matches/page.tsx:**
```tsx
import { JoinTournamentPlayerDialog } from '@/components/tournaments/join-tournament-player-dialog'
import { SimpleTournamentManager } from '@/components/tournaments/simple-tournament-manager'
import { usePlayerTournamentStore } from '@/stores/player-tournament-store'
```

2. **Replace JoinTournamentDialog with JoinTournamentPlayerDialog**

3. **Show SimpleTournamentManager when tournament selected**

## üéØ Current Status

**Working:**
- ‚úÖ Join tournament with code
- ‚úÖ Submit players
- ‚úÖ Generate bracket
- ‚úÖ View two-sided bracket
- ‚úÖ Drag-and-drop editing
- ‚úÖ Lock/unlock bracket

**Needs Integration:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Replace old tournament dialogs in main page
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Score entry component
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Tournament creation for player-based

**Next Steps:**
1. Run database schema migration
2. Test join flow end-to-end
3. Add score entry
4. Polish UI/UX
